# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the CodeWise project's ingestion and context delivery system. The current implementation suffers from poor file coverage (missing key file types), ineffective chunking strategies that break code structure, and weak retrieval mechanisms that often return irrelevant or no results. This enhancement will implement a comprehensive solution including expanded file type support, AST-based chunking, hybrid search capabilities, and robust diagnostic systems to ensure high-quality context delivery for AI-powered code assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive File Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer using CodeWise, I want the system to index all relevant file types in my codebase, so that I can get comprehensive context for any query about my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the indexer scans a workspace THEN it SHALL include files with extensions: .py, .js, .ts, .tsx, .jsx, .md, .txt, .json, .html, .css, .yaml, .yml, .toml, .lock, .env, .config
2. WHEN the indexer encounters dotfiles (files starting with .) THEN it SHALL include them if they match valid extensions
3. WHEN the indexer encounters symlinks THEN it SHALL follow safe symlinks but skip circular references and block devices
4. WHEN the indexer encounters files without extensions THEN it SHALL detect text files by content analysis (no binary markers, size < 100KB)
5. WHEN the indexer encounters binary files THEN it SHALL skip them and log the exclusion
6. WHEN the indexer completes a scan THEN it SHALL log statistics showing file types processed and skipped counts

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Code Chunking

**User Story:** As a developer querying code functionality, I want the system to preserve code structure and context in chunks, so that I receive meaningful and complete code snippets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Python files THEN the system SHALL use AST-based chunking to preserve function and class boundaries
2. WHEN processing JavaScript/TypeScript files THEN the system SHALL use AST-based chunking to preserve function and class boundaries  
3. WHEN processing configuration files THEN the system SHALL store them as single chunks with section metadata
4. WHEN processing Markdown files THEN the system SHALL chunk by headline sections with 50-character overlap
5. WHEN processing small files (< 500 characters) THEN the system SHALL store them as single chunks
6. WHEN creating chunks THEN the system SHALL include metadata: file_type, function_name, class_name, imports, line_numbers
7. WHEN chunking fails due to syntax errors THEN the system SHALL fallback to character-based chunking

### Requirement 3: Hybrid Search Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer searching for specific code patterns, I want the system to combine semantic and keyword-based search, so that I can find exact matches and conceptually similar code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search query THEN the system SHALL execute both vector similarity search and BM25 keyword search
2. WHEN combining search results THEN the system SHALL use a re-ranking model to score final relevance
3. WHEN a query contains specific technical terms THEN the system SHALL boost BM25 results for exact matches
4. WHEN vector search returns low similarity scores THEN the system SHALL fallback to BM25 results
5. WHEN query mentions file types (e.g., "Python") THEN the system SHALL add mandatory file type filters
6. WHEN search returns results THEN the system SHALL provide relevance scores above 0.25 threshold
7. WHEN no results meet threshold THEN the system SHALL expand search with related terms

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Context Delivery

**User Story:** As a developer receiving AI responses, I want the system to provide relevant, well-structured context with proper attribution, so that I can understand and verify the information source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delivering context to LLM THEN the system SHALL include exact file paths and line numbers
2. WHEN context exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL prioritize most relevant chunks using re-ranking scores
3. WHEN no relevant context is found THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "No specific references found"
4. WHEN context is retrieved THEN the system SHALL log token counts and context utilization metrics
5. WHEN multiple chunks from same file are selected THEN the system SHALL merge adjacent chunks when possible
6. WHEN context includes code THEN the system SHALL format it with proper syntax highlighting markers
7. WHEN context delivery fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback directory-based summaries

### Requirement 5: Diagnostic and Monitoring System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive diagnostics and monitoring of the ingestion and retrieval process, so that I can identify and resolve performance issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN indexing completes THEN the system SHALL report file coverage percentage (target >98% of text files)
2. WHEN search queries execute THEN the system SHALL log retrieval metrics: query, results count, relevance scores
3. WHEN context utilization is low THEN the system SHALL emit warnings and suggest query improvements
4. WHEN zero results occur THEN the system SHALL trigger diagnostic analysis and suggest remediation
5. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide real-time alerts with specific metrics
6. WHEN validation tests run THEN the system SHALL achieve >70% precision@5 for test query set
7. WHEN zero-result rate exceeds 5% THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger partial re-indexing

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer using CodeWise, I want fast and efficient search and retrieval, so that I can maintain productive workflow without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large codebases THEN the system SHALL complete indexing within 5 minutes for 10,000 files
2. WHEN executing search queries THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for 95% of queries
3. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL use efficient vector compression to minimize storage overhead
4. WHEN updating indexes THEN the system SHALL perform incremental updates rather than full rebuilds when possible
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to optimize performance
6. WHEN concurrent queries execute THEN the system SHALL handle at least 10 simultaneous searches without degradation
7. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade with informative user feedback

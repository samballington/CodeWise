# Context Delivery Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The CodeWise system has a critical issue where context delivery works for the first query but fails for subsequent queries, even when asking about the same imported repositories. This results in the AI being unable to answer questions about codebases that it previously had access to.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consistent Context Retrieval

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to consistently retrieve relevant context for all my queries, not just the first one, so that I can have ongoing conversations about my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask a question about an imported repository THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context chunks
2. WHEN I ask a follow-up question about the same repository THEN the system SHALL continue to find relevant context
3. WHEN I switch between different imported repositories in my questions THEN the system SHALL find context for each repository appropriately
4. WHEN the system finds context for a query THEN it SHALL maintain the same context retrieval capability for subsequent queries

### Requirement 2: Robust Relevance Scoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use appropriate relevance thresholds that don't filter out valid context, so that my questions get answered with the available codebase information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs vector search THEN it SHALL use relevance thresholds that allow valid context to pass through
2. WHEN no results meet the primary threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically lower the threshold to find available context
3. WHEN the system calculates relevance scores THEN it SHALL properly account for project names and file types mentioned in queries
4. WHEN multiple search strategies are used THEN the system SHALL combine results effectively without over-filtering

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Context Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use multiple search strategies to find relevant context, so that it can answer questions even when simple keyword matching fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary search strategy fails THEN the system SHALL try alternative search approaches
2. WHEN searching for project-specific information THEN the system SHALL boost results from files in that project directory
3. WHEN extracting key terms from queries THEN the system SHALL identify project names, file names, and technical terms accurately
4. WHEN no specific context is found THEN the system SHALL provide directory-based fallback information

### Requirement 4: Improved Logging and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed logging of the context retrieval process, so that I can understand why context delivery succeeds or fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs context search THEN it SHALL log the search parameters and results count
2. WHEN relevance filtering is applied THEN it SHALL log how many results were filtered out and why
3. WHEN context delivery fails THEN it SHALL log the specific failure reasons and attempted fallbacks
4. WHEN the system switches between search strategies THEN it SHALL log the strategy changes and their effectiveness

### Requirement 5: State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the context delivery system to maintain consistent state between queries, so that subsequent queries don't lose access to previously available information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes search components THEN it SHALL maintain their state across multiple queries
2. WHEN vector store or BM25 index is accessed THEN it SHALL remain available for subsequent queries
3. WHEN search parameters are set THEN they SHALL remain consistent unless explicitly changed
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL recover gracefully without losing search capability

# CodeWise Portfolio Sprint - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform CodeWise into a focused "Developer Onboarding Assistant" - a 9/10 portfolio project that demonstrates advanced AI/ML skills, full-stack development, and real-world problem-solving within a 1-2 week sprint using AI assistance.

**Core Value Proposition:** "Helps developers understand unfamiliar codebases in minutes instead of weeks through intelligent Q&A and contextual code exploration."

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Core Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer exploring an unfamiliar codebase, I want to ask natural language questions and get accurate, contextual answers every time, so that I can quickly understand how the system works.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I ask "How does user authentication work?" THEN the system SHALL return a comprehensive explanation with relevant code snippets within 3 seconds
2. WHEN I ask about database entities THEN the system SHALL consistently find and explain all entity relationships and properties
3. WHEN the system encounters an error THEN it SHALL provide helpful error messages and graceful degradation
4. WHEN I ask the same question multiple times THEN the system SHALL return consistent, high-quality answers
5. WHEN I explore different projects THEN the system SHALL maintain context isolation without cross-contamination

### Requirement 2: Professional User Experience

**User Story:** As a potential employer or recruiter, I want to see a polished, professional interface that demonstrates attention to detail and user experience design.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I visit the application THEN I SHALL see a clean, modern interface with clear navigation
2. WHEN I submit a query THEN I SHALL see immediate feedback with loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN results are returned THEN they SHALL be formatted with syntax highlighting, proper spacing, and clear structure
4. WHEN I use the application on different devices THEN it SHALL be responsive and functional
5. WHEN I encounter errors THEN I SHALL see user-friendly error messages with suggested actions

### Requirement 3: Impressive Demo Scenarios

**User Story:** As someone evaluating this project, I want to see compelling demo scenarios that showcase the system's capabilities and technical sophistication.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I ask "Explain the database schema and relationships" THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive overview with entity diagrams
2. WHEN I ask "How would changing the User model affect other parts of the system?" THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies and potential impacts
3. WHEN I ask "Show me the authentication flow step by step" THEN the system SHALL trace the complete flow across multiple files
4. WHEN I ask framework-specific questions THEN the system SHALL demonstrate deep understanding of Spring Boot, Django, etc.
5. WHEN I explore the sample projects THEN each SHALL showcase different technical capabilities

### Requirement 4: Technical Excellence Documentation

**User Story:** As a technical interviewer, I want to understand the sophisticated technical implementation behind the system to evaluate the candidate's engineering skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I review the README THEN I SHALL see clear architecture diagrams and technical explanations
2. WHEN I examine the code THEN it SHALL be well-structured, commented, and follow best practices
3. WHEN I look at the project structure THEN it SHALL demonstrate understanding of software architecture principles
4. WHEN I review the implementation THEN I SHALL see evidence of AI/ML integration, vector search, and real-time systems
5. WHEN I check the testing THEN there SHALL be comprehensive test coverage with meaningful test cases

### Requirement 5: Portfolio Presentation Materials

**User Story:** As a job candidate, I want compelling presentation materials that effectively communicate the project's value and my technical skills to potential employers.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I present this project THEN I SHALL have a 2-minute demo video showing key features
2. WHEN recruiters visit the GitHub repo THEN they SHALL immediately understand the project's purpose and technical complexity
3. WHEN I discuss the project in interviews THEN I SHALL have clear talking points about challenges solved and technical decisions
4. WHEN employers evaluate the project THEN they SHALL see evidence of full-stack skills, AI integration, and product thinking
5. WHEN the project is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a professional URL with sample data loaded

## Success Validation Checklist

### Technical Excellence
- [ ] All 4 core demo scenarios work flawlessly
- [ ] Response times under 3 seconds for 90% of queries
- [ ] Zero crashes or broken states in demo environment
- [ ] Professional UI with proper loading states and error handling
- [ ] Clean, well-documented code with comprehensive tests

### Portfolio Impact
- [ ] Compelling 2-minute demo video

### Demo Scenarios Validation
1. **Authentication Flow:** "How does login work?" → Complete flow explanation with code
2. **Database Schema:** "Show me all entities" → Comprehensive entity overview with relationships
3. **Architecture Overview:** "Explain the system" → High-level architecture with component interactions
4. **Impact Analysis:** "What if I change User model?" → Dependency analysis with affected areas

Each scenario must work consistently and provide impressive, detailed responses that demonstrate the system's capabilities.
